\section{Why \underline{C\#} is a very nice programming language?}
\label{sec:Csharp}

\par
In this short chapter I will summarize some facts about \textbf{C\#} programming language, that i found on the internet. Let's start with some history.

\subsection{What is C\#, and where does it come from?}

\par
\textbf{C\#} is a general-purpose programming language that was developed by Microsoft's Danish software engineer \textbf{Anders Hejlsberg} in the year 2000. Comparing to other widely used general-purpose programming languages like Python or PHP, C\# is a relatively new language with only 20 years of history, yet it has become one of the most popular in history. Based on the \textbf{PYPL (PopularitY of Programming Language)} index it's 4th in popularity as of Nov. 2021, beyond some of the "legendary" languages like C/C++ and PHP.

\par
One of the greatest advantages of C\# is that one of its main design goals was to be a completely \textbf{O}bject \textbf{O}riented \textbf{P}rogramming language which is a relatively new idea in the programming world, and which comes with many benefits. As it comes to other advantages C\# has a pretty low learning curve as it is a simple to read language in comparison with languages like C or PHP. It is great choice for beginners that have some general idea about programming as C\# is simple to read and start coding with, but not as simple as for example Python.

\subsection{Where is it used?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item [\#] Windows apps - it was developed by Windows for Windows so of course they'll gonna use it.
    \item [\#] Website development - it is possible to develop very efficient, scalable websites with C\#.
    \item [\#] Mobile apps - in C\# you can make programs for many different platforms, not only Windows. That includes mobile apps.
    \item [\#] Games - C\# as it is a OPP language is great in game dev, besides the most widely used Game Engine, Unity uses C\# as its default language.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Funny facts}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In the beginning C\# would be named "COOL", which was an acronym for "C-like Object Oriented Language", Microsoft considered using it as the official name but in the end changed it because of trademark reasons.
    \item The name "C sharp" was inspired by the musical notation whereby a sharp symbol indicates that the written note should be made a semitone higher in pitch.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Some random math equations}
Laplace expansion
\begin{equation}
    detB=\sum_{j=1}^{n}(-1)^{i+j}M_{ij}B_{ij}
\end{equation}

Trigonometry
\begin{equation}
    sin(arcsin x) = x, x\epsilon [-1, 1]
\end{equation}
