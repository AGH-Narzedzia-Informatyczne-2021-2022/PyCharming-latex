\section{Why programming is so \underline{hard} for a rookie?} 
\subsection{The variety of the languages}
For a programming newbie like \textbf{me}, there is too much knowledge which I`m demanded to get in a very short period of time. Not only there are many languages, every language has its own set of functions and 'mechanics'.When I learn one language (for example C) and on the other day i`m practising another one ( for example Python) I sometimes get into a muddle and mess my project. The good thing is that I understand all IT memes like  this one:

\end{figure}

\subsection{Why am I doing this if it`s that hard?}
\subsubsection{Because there are so many good things about it! Here are some examples:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[a)] it`s really motivating knowing how much you`ve progress even after only one month,
    \item[b)] I can finally use all my grey cells to figure out the problem!,
    \item[c)] I can create some real apps which help other people,
    \item[d)] It`s really amazing having a chance to work with some incredible people like those one
    \item[e)] Memes really bring me back to life( like this table \ref{table:math} and this whole chapter)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Showing you my experience, let`s talk about \underline{facts}}
Here are some table, which shows how programming is getting more and more interests over the last decades
\input{Tables/table6}
\subsection{I love Math!}
Math has a lot of in common with IT, because it`s used very often to create or develop some algorithms
and on the other hand there are many programs which help us deepen our Math knowledge!
But I`ll show you just the \textbf{\emph{perfect}} equation:\\       $$ e^{{\pi}{i}}=-1$$ \\
And another one ( not that perfect):\\ $$(a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}$$
